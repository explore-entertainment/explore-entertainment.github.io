					<p class="lead">
						What comes after "Hello World"?
					</p>

					<p>
						The internet is full of countless tutorials for game development.
						Many are "for beginners"—they cover setting up a development environment,
						getting started writing code in whatever language, and rendering simple graphics.
						There are also plenty of advanced tutorials covering specific features, or rendering
						techniques, or design patterns. But there's a big gap between the two groups. Many
						beginners have trouble going from "Hello World" to being able to use that fancy
						rendering technique or design pattern. This series is an attempt to help bridge that gap.
					</p>

					<p>
						In these tutorials, I start by showing how to write a simple game with direct,
						straightforward code. Then I'll show you how to start refining that code into a library
						of tools you can use to make another game more easily. Because that's step two: Another Game.
						We'll add some more features to our budding game library, as well as adding structure
						with new systems and design patterns.
					</p>

					<p>
						And after that? You guessed it! Another Game.
						And another, and another, and another. Each game will build on the tools we created
						in the previous one. At the end of the road, we'll have made a capable game library
						you can use to continue making better games. And you'll know it's capable because you'll
						have already used it to make a dozen different games.
					</p>

					<h5>What This Is</h5>
					<p>
						Game Architecture Basics is a tutorial series about the design and architecture of
						gaming software. Its target audience is aspiring game programmers who have
						run into The Gap. If you've gone through the Hello World tutorials,
						you've gotten your first triangle rendered, you've tried making a complete game,
						but your code keeps getting unusably tangled—congratulations! You're
						the person I wrote this for.
					</p>

					<h5>What This Isn't</h5>
					<p>
						This is NOT a Hello World tutorial of its own. If you've never written
						a line of code before, this series will not teach you how to do that.
						I won't cover setting up your environment or managing dependencies.
						I won't teach you everything about how OpenGL works or how to deploy a game.
						This series is also not about producing art assets or sound effects
						or music or designing fun games. This series is for coders who would like to
						write better code.
					</p>

					<h5>Technologies</h5>
					<p>
						This series uses Java as the programming language and OpenGL for rendering.
						I use IntelliJ IDEA as my development environment because that's what Android
						Studio is. When I want to make a mobile game I don't have to change my workflow.
						Maven provides dependendy management.
					</p>
					<p>
						I use JOGL for OpenGL bindings in Java. LWJGL seems more popular, but more limited.
						JOGL makes window creation very simple and allows for multiple windows that can
						share GL resources—a very useful feature for creating tools like map editors
						and scene viewers.
					</p>

					<h5>Priorities</h5>
					<p>
						A famous idea in project management is called the Iron Triangle: the sides of a triangle
						are labeled Time, Cost, and Scope. If one side grows longer or shorter, at least one
						of the other sides has to compensate. So we have to choose to prioritize the sides
						that are most important for the project's success and accept that the other sides
						have to be adjusted accordingly. People have come up with other labels for the
						triangle, but this is the core idea: start with the goals that are most important
						and accept that everything else has to compensate in some way.
					</p>
					<p>
						This tutorial series is meant to demonstrate simple design principles that can be
						used by less-experienced programmers to help them make games more easily. So my first
						priorities will be <strong>Simplicity</strong> and <strong>Usefulness</strong>. If
						you're worried about performance: don't. New game developers (really <em>most</em>
						game developers) don't need to worry about hitting the bleeding edge of performance.
						Just finishing a game is difficult enough. If you get to that point and still need
						to worry about performance, <em>congratulations!</em> You've won. You've accomplished
						more in a very difficult field than most who set out on this road. So this series
						is only concerned with helping you get to that point.
					</p>

					<h5>Design Principles</h5>
					<p>
						These tutorials teach code design and architecture, so I need to go over some
						of the basic principles we'll use to guide our decisions.  Even if you don't
						end up using the exact same architecture I build here, following these principles
						will be a huge help in developing your own systems.  Some of these come from
						courses named things like Object-Oriented Programming and Design because OOP
						seems to be the default these days.  It isn't, and these principles are still
						sound if you work in other paradigms; and I'll take ideas from other paradigms
						as well.

						<h6>Abstraction</h6>
						If you take away nothing else from this series, learn this.  Abstraction is
						the cornerstone of everything in computing.  It's all about hiding details
						behind an interface that's easier to understand.  Computers are machines that
						process <em>machine code</em>, which is expressed in binary.  Binary is hard
						to understand, so assembly languages were created to make it easier.  Assembly
						is still hard to understand, so higher-level languages were invented, like C
						and FORTRAN.  You still had to write specific code for specific machines, so
						operating systems were created, like DOS and UNIX.  You still had to write
						specific code for particular devices, so device drivers were created.  You
						still had to write specific code for each operating system, so platforms were
						created (like the JVM and Microsoft's .Net platform.) These technologies are
						all stacked up on top of the binary code that was hard to use. Each of these
						things is still there; they're just hidden behind abstractions.

						<h6>Single Responsibility</h6>
						This goes hand-in-hand with abstraction.  The idea is that every distinct
						<em>thing</em> you create should serve a single purpose.  It should have
						one single responsibility.  It's the scope of those responsibilities that
						will change.  And it's still just a stack of abstractions.  At the top of
						the stack is our Game class.  It's responsible for running the game and
						nothing else.  It does that by using a Rendering system, an Input system,
						an Audio system, etc.  Each of these systems does only one thing.  To do that
						they're composed of smaller parts that each do only one thing.  Get the idea?
						This goes all the way down to the lowest levels of our code.  When you create
						a new class, make sure it does only one thing.  When you write a new function,
						make sure it only does one thing.

						<h6>Code Reuse</h6>
						This one is also known as Don't Repeat Yourself.  If you find yourself writing
						a chunk of code you've written before <em>in a similar context</em>, it's time
						to refactor.  Tuck away that duplicate code in a function and call the function
						in its place.  If that isn't easy to do, you're probably
						looking at a good place to add a new abstraction <em>or it's a symptom of poor
						design choices.</em>  But remember that note above about a similar context.
						You'll end up writing many, many <samp>for</samp> loops, for example.   That
						doesn't mean you need to figure out how create a single abstraction so that
						you never have to write another <samp>for</samp> loop again.  Otherwise we
						would already have that abstraction.  But if you're writing multiple <samp>for</samp>
						loops to iterate over the same structure, that can almost certainly be hidden
						in an abstraction.

						<h6>Inheritance and Composition</h6>
						Don't think that this principle is less important because it's at the bottom
						of the list.  This is a vitally important idea on its own, and also because of how
						programming is taught in schools (at least when I was in school.)  The way
						inheritance was taught when I was first learning, it seemed like the magic hammer.
						Need to create an abstraction?  Design an elaborate class heirearchy.  Need to
						clean up some code duplication?  Put it in a base class and extend it to reuse that 
						code.  This line of thinking is BAD BAD BAD.  Inheritance is <em>usually</em>
						the wrong tool for the job.  I don't care what the job is. You can probably solve
						it in a better way without inheritance.
						<br/><br/>
						So what do you use instead?  Composition.  This is just a fancy word that means
						<em>Have your object contain the things it needs.</em>  Rather than extending
						a base class to reuse some bit of functionality, put it in its own class and
						then just use an object of that class.  This makes for better single responsibility;
						more abstract abstractions; and easier code reuse.
					</p>

					<h5>Assets</h5>
					<p>
						I said above that these tutorials won't teach you how to create art assets. My examples
						will use art provided by <a href="https://www.kenney.nl">Kenney</a>.  He's created
						lots of 2D and 3D art and provides nearly all of it for free.  How cool is that??
					</p>

					<h5>Enough Words</h5>
